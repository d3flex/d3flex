❯ now put the full readme together                                                                                                              
                                   
● ### Welcome to my code space                                                                                                                  
              
  I'm **d3flex**, a Software Engineer at SUSE.                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                
  I work across a range of areas — from kernel and HPC to containers and public cloud infrastructure, including work on MicroOS and related     
  tooling. Beyond my day job, I enjoy expanding into new territory: whether that's hacking my system, contributing to projects that catch my    
  interest, or exploring new domains entirely. Things you might find here include Django projects, compilers, AI tools, scripts, and config
  files.
